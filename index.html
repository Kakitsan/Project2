      <h1>Jiajie Zeng's Project 2: drawing tool</h1>
      <p>In project 2, I want to create a little drawing tool with p5.js and paper.js. Both of them are very good to create line because they have many functions to make some difference with the lanes that the user draws.</p>

      <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw">P5.js Example</a>
      <p>In p5.js part, I was looking for some function that can allow me to feel free to draw something on the canvas. I add the symmetry feature to the drawing function, which can symmetrically draw two lines at the same time. I think in this way, the user can draw some patterns easier and faster. Also, I make the gradient effect on the line, which will make the audience feel they draw a pattern with ink.</p>

      <a href="http://paperjs.org/tutorials/interaction/mouse-tool-events/">Paper.js Example</a>
      <p>In paper.js, I want to make a drawing tool but there is something different from the p5.js part. I found the mouse press function and mouse drag function, which make the brush controlable. And the track of the brush is kinda interesting because when the user draw lines, those lines have some random changes like a little bit up and down and random strokecolor. I think it is good to play and create something excited.</p>

    <p>Here is the modified version. And the user can use two tool to draw a mixed pattern or draw separately.</p>
